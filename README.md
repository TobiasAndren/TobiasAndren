## 👋 Hi there, I'm Tobias Andrén

I'm an aspiring web developer based in Sweden with a passion for solving real-world problems through clean and user-friendly digital solutions.

💡 I’m currently studying Web Development at YRGO, where I’ve had the opportunity to work on hands-on projects involving React, TypeScript, and modern tools like Supabase and Next.js. In one of my recent projects, I developed a responsive movie recommendation app where users can get suggestions based on their favorite films – a project that deepened my interest in frontend development.
